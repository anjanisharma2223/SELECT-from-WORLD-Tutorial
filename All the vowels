Equatorial Guinea and Dominican Republic have all of the vowels (a e i o u) in the name. 
They don't count because they have more than one word in the name.
Find the country that has all the vowels and no spaces in its name.
You can use the phrase name NOT LIKE '%a%' to exclude characters from your results.
